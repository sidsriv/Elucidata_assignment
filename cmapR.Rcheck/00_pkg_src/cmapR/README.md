### Install instructions

Dependencies are listed in `DESCRIPTION`



**Installing from source**

Perhaps the simplest way is to install directly from github using `devtools::install_github("cmap/cmapR")`. Note that this requires having previously installed the `devtools` package.

Alternatively, you can point your R's `install.packages` function at a tarball of the `cmapR` archive. You can generate this archive by cloning this repository and doing the following:

	# make a gzip tar ball of the repo
	R CMD build cmapR
	# makes cmapR_1.0.tar.gz
	
	# check that the package is ok
	R CMD check cmapR_1.0.tar.gz	

Once you have created the tarball, open an R terminal and execute the following:

	install.packages("cmapR_1.0.tar.gz", type="source", repos=NULL)
	library("cmapR")


You can also source individual files as needed instead of installing the entire package.

	# For example, just load the IO methods
	source("cmapR/R/io.R")
